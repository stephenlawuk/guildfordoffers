Just enter your NUS Extra card number when you sign up.\r\n\r\nAnd we did away with contracts that tie you in, so if you find that money gets too tight, you can take a month or two off while you get your finances in order.\r\n\r\nBut at just Â£15.99 a month* we think The Gym is unbeatably affordable and tremendous value for money. Where else could you get a monthâ€™s access to premium fitness equipment, 24/7, for less than a night out at the student union bar?\r\n\r\nOpen 24/7. Thatâ€™s right. Perfect for the student timetable. We remember pulling all-nighters to get essays and dissertations done on deadline. Which means youâ€™re wide awake at 4am. Now you can keep your body active at any time of day or night as well as your mind.\r\n\r\n170+ premium fitness machines and free weights. Whether youâ€™re a fitness fanatic, want to drop a dress size or just want to burn off the booze, weâ€™ve got the right equipment for you. With so many machines available you can get on that treadmill without cooling your heels, or really mix up your workouts to keep your body guessing.\r\n\r\nHave we sold it to you yet?\r\n\r\nHave your NUS Extra card handy when you sign up, to make sure you benefit from the full student discount.\r\n\r\n* Â£15.99 a month where The Gym is already open. If youâ€™re studying in a city where The Gym is soon to make an appearance you can sign up for Â£10.99 a month guaranteed for the first year. Thatâ€™s less than getting a round in! So donâ€™t waste time, sign up now.

Where else could you get a monthâ€™s access to premium fitness equipment, 24/7, for less than a night out at the student union bar?\r\n\r\nOpen 24/7. Thatâ€™s right. Perfect for the student timetable. We remember pulling all-nighters to get essays and dissertations done on deadline. Which means youâ€™re wide awake at 4am. Now you can keep your body active at any time of day or night as well as your mind.\r\n\r\n170+ premium fitness machines and free weights. Whether youâ€™re a fitness fanatic, want to drop a dress size or just want to burn off the booze, weâ€™ve got the right equipment for you. With so many machines available you can get on that treadmill without cooling your heels, or really mix up your workouts to keep your body guessing.\r\n\r\nHave we sold it to you yet?\r\n\r\nHave your NUS Extra card handy when you sign up, to make sure you benefit from the full student discount.\r\n\r\n* Â£15.99 a month where The Gym is already open. If youâ€™re studying in a city where The Gym is soon to make an appearance you can sign up for Â£10.99 a month guaranteed for the first year. Thatâ€™s less than getting a round in! So donâ€™t waste time, sign up now.

Now you can keep your body active at any time of day or night as well as your mind.\r\n\r\n170+ premium fitness machines and free weights. Whether youâ€™re a fitness fanatic, want to drop a dress size or just want to burn off the booze, weâ€™ve got the right equipment for you. With so many machines available you can get on that treadmill without cooling your heels, or really mix up your workouts to keep your body guessing.\r\n\r\nHave we sold it to you yet?\r\n\r\nHave your NUS Extra card handy when you sign up, to make sure you benefit from the full student discount.\r\n\r\n* Â£15.99 a month where The Gym is already open. If youâ€™re studying in a city where The Gym is soon to make an appearance you can sign up for Â£10.99 a month guaranteed for the first year. Thatâ€™s less than getting a round in!

Where else could you get a monthâ€™s access to premium fitness equipment, 24/7, for less than a night out at the student union bar?\r\n\r\nOpen 24/7. Thatâ€™s right. Perfect for the student timetable. We remember pulling all-nighters to get essays and dissertations done on deadline. Which means youâ€™re wide awake at 4am. Now you can keep your body active at any time of day or night as well as your mind.\r\n\r\n170+ premium fitness machines and free weights. Whether youâ€™re a fitness fanatic, want to drop a dress size or just want to burn off the booze, weâ€™ve got the right equipment for you. With so many machines available you can get on that treadmill without cooling your heels, or really mix up your workouts to keep your body guessing.\r\n\r\nHave we sold it to you yet?\r\n\r\nHave your NUS Extra card handy when you sign up, to make sure you benefit from the full student discount.\r\n\r\n* Â£15.99 a month where The Gym is already open. If youâ€™re studying in a city where The Gym is soon to make an appearance you can sign up for Â£10.99 a month guaranteed for the first year. Thatâ€™s less than getting a round in! So donâ€™t waste time, sign up now.
